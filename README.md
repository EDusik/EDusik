# Eduardo Dusik

Hello, my name is <b>Eduardo Dusik</b> and I'm a front-end web developer passionate about it. I enjoy listening to power metal and i'm unable to stay without coffee.<br/><br/>
I'm a spontaneous and curious person by nature, who likes chess and nerd stuff, from Lord of the Rings and card games to Warhammer 40k.<br/>
